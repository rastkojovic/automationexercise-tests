# Automation Exercise UI Test Suite

Automated functional UI tests for the [Automation Exercise](https://www.automationexercise.com/) web application, built using **Python**, **Selenium WebDriver**, and **PyTest**.  

This project follows the **Page Object Model (POM)** pattern to keep tests organized, maintainable, and scalable.
